# PHYS321_Final_Project

For the final project, please see the final report titled 'PHYS_321_Final_report.pdf', and the jupyter notebook 'Time_Series_analysis_ARIMA_MCMC.ipynb'.

I did all the data and code exploration in  the 'weather_data_treatment.ipynb' notebook, which is a complete mess, so it can be ignored.

The 'src' folder contains the scripts I used to clean the weather data, the 'data' folder contains all the weather data csv files, and the 'images' folder contains all the figures and plots I used for the final report.

EDIT:
I just realized the data folder contains the cleaned weather data, whereas the data/cleaned_data folder actually contains the raw weather data, woops!


Thank you!
